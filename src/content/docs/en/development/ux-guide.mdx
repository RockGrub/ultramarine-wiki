### The Helium Human Interface Guidelines Can Be Found on [**Fyra Developer**](https://developer.fyralabs.com/helium/hig)

We recommend the Helium Human Interface Guidelines. They're built in house to provide a modern and friendly experience. They were originally designed for the Helium UI Library but you can apply the principles to any UI libraries nonetheless.

These guidelines are not a be-all-end-all and you are free to ignore parts or add your own ideals. It's your app after all :P
