Most of the team has a modern Tegra device, most commonly, the Nintendo Switch.
There is interest in running Ultramarine on these devices, but we havenâ€™t started work on a port yet.

In the meanwhile, we are tracking the progress of the [Switchroot](https://switchroot.org/) project, which aims to bring Linux to the Nintendo Switch and
other Tegra-based SoCs, such as the Jetson/Xavier/Orin series, the NVIDIA Shield and more.
