While our team has some experience with NVIDIA Tegra devices, especially the Nintendo Switch.
We have not yet started work on supporting these devices in Ultramarine, and they are still in the **Wishlist Phase**.

In the meanwhile, we are tracking the progress of the [Switchroot](https://switchroot.org/) project, which aims to bring Linux to the Nintendo Switch and
other Tegra-based SoCs, such as the Jetson/Xavier/Orin series, the NVIDIA Shield and more.
