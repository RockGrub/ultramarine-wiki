[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) is a feature in Windows 10 and 11 that, in essence, is a Linux system as a Windows application.

Ultramarine only supports WSL2. WSL2 is essentially a "lightweight utility virtual machine" running through Hyper-V, Microsoft's hypervisor. This gives Ultramarine full access to the Windows filesystem, and direct hardware access, with performance similar to that of baremetal Linux.

It is possible to install and run graphical Linux applications, and even full desktop environments. We plan to make running a desktop environment through Ultramarine WSL easier in the future.

## System Requirements

WSL2, and by extension Ultramarine WSL, needs the following:

- Windows 10 (Version 2004 Build 19041), or Windows 11. IPv6 may have issues in Windows 10.
- Hardware Virtualization enabled. Note all pre-installed Windows 11 computers come with Virtualization enabled.
- For DDEV, at least 8GBs RAM and 256GBs storage is required.

**DDEV** is a local web development tool for Drupal, and is recommended to run on Docker through WSL2, rather then Docker through Windows, but has higher hardware requirements then WSL itself. For more information, click [here](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/local-server-setup/windows-development-environment/installing-drupal-with-ddev-in-wsl2-on-windows).

To determine your virtualization status, look in Task Manager -> Preformance tab -> CPU, and locate virtualization information. You can also open a command prompt or PowerShell window and run the following command:

```
systeminfo.exe
```

Locate the 'Hyper-V Requirements' section, near the bottom. Within that section, locate 'Virtualization Enabled In Firmware: yes/no.' If yes, you are good to go. If no, you will need to enable it in your UEFI/BIOS.

## How to enable Virtualization in your UEFI/BIOS

- Enter the UEFI/BIOS of your system, restart your device, then enter your bios/setup key. A list of these keys can be found [here](/en/setup/bioskeys).
- Locate the virtualization option. This can be in various places depending on the motherboard/manufactorer. Typically, this will be in the CPU settings/configuration menu. If unsure, research the option location according to your motherboard/computer.
- Save and exit, with a key or option in the base of the UEFI/BIOS menu.

Hardware virtualization should now be enabled, and you can proceed to the installation section.

## Installation

There are a few different methods to install Ultramarine WSL, here are all supported methods.

### Install from the Microsoft Store

First we must install WSL. Open an administrator Command Prompt or PowerShell window, and enter the following command:

```
wsl --install
```

This will install everything needed for WSL, assuming the requirements are met. By default, this will also install Ubuntu for WSL. Ubuntu is the default WSL distro, but you can change your default, or delete Ubuntu. Deleting Ubuntu is out of the scope of this guide, but see [below](/en/anywhere/wsl#changing-your-default-wsl-distro-to-ultramarine) on changing your default distro to Ultramarine WSL.

Then, open the Microsoft Store, and search 'Ultramarine Linux' in the Microsoft Store app, or [this link] NEEDS LINK THAT DOESNT EXIST YET

Select 'Ultramarine Linux,' verify the author is Fyra Labs, and then select 'Get.'

After this, Ultramarine WSL will appear as a Windows application. You can select 'Open' from the Microsoft Store window, and process to post installation steps.

### Install WSL2 and Ultramarine with a Single Command

Open an administrator Command Prompt or PowerShell window, and enter the following command:

```
wsl --install -d ultramarine
```

This will install everything needed for WSL, and Ultramarine WSL, assuming the requirements are met. Ultramarine WSL will now appear as a Windows application and you are now ready for the post-install section.

### Install with WinGet

First we must install WSL. Open an administrator Command Prompt or PowerShell window, and enter the following command:

```
wsl --install
```

This will install everything needed for WSL, assuming the requirements are met. By default, this will also install Ubuntu for WSL. Ubuntu is the default WSL distro, but you can change your default, or delete Ubuntu. Deleting Ubuntu is out of the scope of this guide, but see [below](/en/anywhere/wsl#changing-your-default-wsl-distro-to-ultramarine) on changing your default distro to Ultramarine WSL.

After this, in the same administrator Command Prompt or PowerShell window, enter this command:

```
winget install ultramarine
```

After this, Ultramarine WSL will appear as a Windows application. This will install everything needed for WSL, and Ultramarine WSL, assuming the requirements are met. You are now ready for the post-install section.

## Post-installation

When you start up Ultramarine WSL for the first time, it may take a bit to install all files. Wait until this finishes to proceed.

### Making a user (REQUIRED)

When you boot into Ultramarine WSL (or and WSL for that matter), you will be prompted to enter a username and password. Follow the prompts to create a user, then sign into your new user, and then you're all good to go!

### Changing your default WSL distro to Ultramarine

To change your default WSL distro to Ultramarine, run the following command:

```
wsl --setdefault Ultramarine
```

If, for whatever reason, Ultramarine is not detected, you can run the following command to list all installed WSL distros:

```
wsl -l
```

Then, replace `Ultramarine` in the setdefault command to your installed distro name.

### Updating

It is always recommended to update a fresh system. To do this, please run the following command:

```
sudo dnf upgrade
```
